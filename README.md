# Logistic-Regression-with-Python-and-Numpy
Logistic Regression is an important fundamental concept if you want break into Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Even though popular machine learning frameworks have implementations of logistic regression available, it's still a great idea to learn to implement it on your own to understand the mechanics of optimization algorithm, and the training and validation process.

Created and trained a logistic model that will be able to predict if a given image is of hand-written digit zero or of hand-written digit one. The model will be able to distinguish between images or 0s and 1s, and it will do that with a very high accuracy. Not only that, implementation of the logistic model will also be able to solve any generic binary classiﬁcation problem. You will still have to train model instances on speciﬁc datasets of course, but you won’t have to change the implementation and it will be re-usable. The dataset for images of hand written digits comes from the popular MNIST dataset. This data set consists of images for the 10 hand-written digits (from 0 to 9), but since we are implementing logistic regression, and are looking to solve binary classiﬁcation problems - we will work with examples of hand written zeros, and hand written ones and we will ignore examples of rest of the digits.
